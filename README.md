# 📘+🌐=❤️ Awesome Book Sites

Book sites show the contents of free-to-read books on the web. In the past year or so, I noticed sites like [Shapeup]([url](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)https://basecamp.com/shapeup) popping up and it got me thinking. Is this a new format? Why is this becoming more common? What else is out there?
