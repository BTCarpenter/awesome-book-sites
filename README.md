[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Book sites show the contents of free-to-read books on the web. In the past year or so, I noticed sites like [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) popping up and it got me thinking. 

- Is this a new format?
- Why is this becoming more common?
- What else is out there?
